# Roots of equations
## Overwiew
This program demonstrates the implementation and usage of numerical root-finding algorithms, specifically the **bisection method**,
**Newton's method**, and **secant method**. It applies these algorithms to solve different equations and providees the results.

## Requirements
- **Python 3**
- **poetry**
